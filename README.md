# Welcome to CI/CD for Logix Control Systems!

This GitHub repository is dedicated to providing a full, comprehensive example of **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Development (CD)** for Rockwell Automation Logix control systems. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for developers looking to implement CI/CD practices in their own Studio 5000 Logix Designer application development.
